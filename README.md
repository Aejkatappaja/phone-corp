# Phone Corp Module

## üí¨ &nbsp; About

This is an exercise from the Tipsi interview process for Junior full-stack developers.</br>
The goal of this exercise is to create a backend module for a phone company</br> to list products and create orders from them.

## üî© &nbsp; Main features

- Retrieve the list of products present in the database.
- Retrieve a specific product.
- Place an order of products.
- Display the list of orders.
- Handle non-passing cases: What to do if the requested product does not exist ? What if the order contains products not present in the database ?
- Qualitatives tests and documentation should be written.

## ÔºüHow to run it

1. `npm install` to install depencies.
2. `npm start` to run the PhoneCorp system. The server will listen port `:4000`.
3. `npm test` to run tests.
4. You can create a `.env` file and place `MONGODB_URL=` followed by your connection string provided by MongoDB to interact with your database.

## üìÅ Architecture

- I decided to create this project trying to build some layers to be able to have a clean and maintenable code.</br>
- I found `services` --> `utils` --> `controllers` --> `routes` a good path to design the project pattern.
- Created a `config` folder to store `mongoose` connection module exports and `env` with `PORT` config.
- Decided to create my `services` and `utils` folders into `database` because it interacts directly with it.
- Defined my tests in two differents folders `functions` and `routes`, both contains `order` and `product`.

## üöè Routes

| Routes            | Methods |                           Function |
| :---------------- | :-----: | ---------------------------------: |
| `/product/create` |  POST   |                   Create a product |
| `/product/stock`  |   GET   |         List all existing products |
| `/product/:id`    |   GET   |      Retrieve a product with `:id` |
| `/product/`       |   GET   | Handle error if `:id` not provided |
| `/order/create`   |  POST   |                      Pass an order |
| `/order/history`  |   GET   |                    List all orders |

### Ôºü How to use

- For `/product/stock`, `product/` and `order/history` routes tou just have to send a `GET` request.
  </br>

- `/product/create` :

```javascript
//example body to send to create a product
{
    "brand": "iPhone",
    "model": "15 Pro Max",
    "sku": 123456,
    "price": 1599,
    "quantity": 3
}
```

## üí™üèº Possible improvements

- Create independents functions to handle errors in API calls.
- Upgrading the module with `product/delete` and `product/update/:id` paths.
- Create an `assets` folder containing a `json` file to store all the reusable `string` messages.
- Edit the project config to be able to import with `@/whatever` instead of `../../../whatever`.
- Move all the functions contained in `getOrder.ts` to keep code cleaner and more maintenable.
- Refactoring some parts of my code to be clearer and more modular.
- Use a Schema Validator like `Zod` to avoid some possibles issues if the app growth.

## üôáüèª What did i learn, improve and discover

- I Improved my TypeScript's knowledges.
- I improved my vision of project architecture.
- I learned how to run tests properly and to test what seemed relevant to me.
- I discovered [mongodb-memory-server](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) which is pretty good for testing interaction with database.

## üí• Annoying encountered issues and how i solved them

### <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/jestjsio/jestjsio-icon.svg" alt="jest" width="18" height="18"/> <u>Jest / TypeScript compatibility</u>

- Had troubles with `Jest` and `TypeScript` compatibility, my tests crashed everytime. </br></br>
- After some investigations
  i discovered that i needed to install :
  </br>
  </br> `babel/core` </br> `babel/preset-env` </br> `babel/preset-typescript` </br> </br>
- Create a `babel.config.js` file and put this inside :

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ["@babel/preset-env", { targets: { node: "current" } }],
    "@babel/preset-typescript",
  ],
};
```

- Also create a `jest.config.js` and put this inside :

```typescript
/** @type {import('ts-jest').JestConfigWithTsJest} */
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: "node",
  preset: "ts-jest --config=jest.config.ts",
  transformIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/(?!(uuid)/)"],
};
```

### üîä <u>Address already in use when testing</u>

- Had troubles running `npm test` because tests failed with this error message :

```typescript
listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::4008
```

- After some investigations i discovered that i needed to mention `(require.main === module) &&` condition in my `index.ts` :

```typescript
require.main === module &&
  server.listen(config.port, () => {
    console.log(
      `‚ö°Ô∏è[server]: Server started üöÄ running at http://localhost:${config.port}`
    );
  });
```

- With this condition the server won't force listening on port 4008 between each tests.

### üõí <u>create/order issues</u>

- Encountered some issues with `order/create` API Response when an order was passed.
- I created a new branch, reworked my schemas and made it works properly.
- Merged it when properly fixed.
- Also had trouble trying to export functions outside of `getOrder.ts`, had a lot of `TypeScript` errors </br> and bugs and i lost too much time trying to clean this. </br>
- It works well like that but it's kind of dirty part of my code, i should rework this later on !
